# Windows Sound Setter ðŸ”Š

If you are a `windows` users, I'm sure that you've already known the way to increase or decrease your volume by nagivating to the bottom right of your screen and look for that slider or somehow you can press on `volumn up/down` if you're using laptop.

By seeing this problem, I created this small tool to show a GUI input to let us type in the volume value and it will set our system sound level to that inputted value.

### Requirement

- autohotkey v2.0 gotta be installed in pc. you can install by:

```powershell
winget install --id Lexikos.AutoHotkey
```

### Start Using

To start using, you can clone this repo or download this <a href="set-sound.ahk">set-sound.ahk</a> file and double click on it to run.

### Controls

- Pressing `F8` to show the GUI
- Pressing `Alt + NumpadPlus` to volumn up by 2%
- Pressing `Alt + NumpadSub` to volumn down by 2%

You can customize `keys` to your liking by editing the script.
